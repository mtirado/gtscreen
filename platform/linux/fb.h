/* aligns sync rectangle to grid
 * 16/32 pixel blocks are always nicely aligned for 8, 16, 32 bpp
 * 32 pixel grid @ 32bpp = 128byte == full xmm line,
 * 64 for ymm, 128 for zmm...
 * but is no good @24bpp, which is currently left unsupported
 *
 * large grid alignment does more harm than good on older cpu's
 * that do not support the newer instructions, repl movsb instruction
 * should probably be used for anything that supports it? i don't have
 * any such space-age hardware to test these theories.
